============

## Overview
The FinchScope project aims to provide a modular in-vivo  optophysiology rig, with a transparent acquisition and analysis pipeline. The goal is to produce a customizable and scaleable single-photon fluorescent imaging microscope system that takes advantage of developing open-source analysis platforms. You can read more about the project [here.](http://iopscience.iop.org/1741-2552/14/4/045001/)

The project was developed by [Will Liberti](https://github.com/WALIII) in the [Gardner Lab](http://people.bu.edu/timothyg/Home.html), for multi-month imaging of neural activity in songbirds [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002158) [[2]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4405) [[3]](https://ccneuro.org/2018/proceedings/1133.pdf) and rodents. This effort would not have been possible without the critical advice and support at the outset of the project by Daniel Aharoni and Peyman Golshani, of the [UCLA Miniscope project](http://miniscope.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

#### Components:


### Finchscope Microscope

The FinchScope is a lightweight wireless-capable microscope for biological imaging- Designed specifically for monitoring the neural activity (via genetically encoded calcium indicators) of zebra finches while they sing their courtship songs. You can find the Construction and Assembly Guide for [the Microscope](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Assembly-Guide), As well as a for the [Data Acquisition Box (DAQ)](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/DAQ-Guide).  Also, we have a [Guide Through a Basic Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Analysis-Guide)


### Active Commutator
The [Active Commutator](https://github.com/WALIII/FreedomScope/wiki/Commutators) is a low cost, low noise, active(driven by a motor and sensor) electrical rotary joint designed for electrophysiology (single and multichannel micro-electrode arrays) and optophysiology ( optogenetics, miniature microscopes, and fiber photometry).
